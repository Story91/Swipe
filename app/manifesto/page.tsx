          <h2 className="section-title">SWIPE: Your Prediction Market Companion</h2>
          <p className="section-text">
            Imagine a world where your insights about the future are truly valuable—where your predictions about tomorrow's events can generate real returns today. That is the promise of prediction markets and decentralized forecasting. With a basic understanding of market dynamics, users can rest assured that their predictions are backed by real economic incentives and fully under their control. No intermediaries. No gatekeepers.
          </p>
          <p className="section-text">
            This vision of predictive autonomy is revolutionary. It allows you to bet on any future event, anywhere in the world, without worrying about traditional market barriers, complex financial instruments, or unseen forces manipulating outcomes. This is the stark difference between decentralized prediction markets and traditional financial speculation.
          </p>
          <p className="section-text">
            Traditional financial markets, for all their sophistication, serve a purpose: they provide liquidity and price discovery for established assets. Whether you're trading stocks, commodities, or currencies, traditional markets thrive on their infrastructure and regulation. However, that infrastructure comes at a heavy, sometimes hidden, cost. Traditional markets are limited to what can be easily standardized and regulated—while charging fees for the privilege of participation. We aren't looking to replace traditional markets, however, we are looking to democratize access to prediction markets when it comes to any future event.
          </p>
          <p className="section-text">
            But in a world where you can predict anything, where do these traditional limitations fit? They don't. Instead, they are replaced by a fragmented maze of platforms, each requiring specialized knowledge and different interfaces. Managing your predictions across multiple platforms means grappling with different wallets, different tokens, and different rules—each requiring specialized knowledge. For many, this complexity is overwhelming, creating a barrier to true predictive empowerment.

          <p className="section-text">

          <div className="payout-explanation">
            <div className="payout-step">
              <h4>1. Platform Fee</h4>
              <p>SWIPE takes 1% fee from the losing pool (not from winners). This ensures sustainable platform development.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div className="payout-step">
              <h4>2. Winner Distribution</h4>
              <p>Winners receive: Original stake + proportional share of remaining losers pool. Example: Bet 1 ETH on YES, YES wins → Get 1 ETH back + share of NO pool.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div className="payout-step">
              <h4>3. Separate Pools</h4>
              <p>ETH stakers compete for ETH rewards, $SWIPE stakers compete for $SWIPE rewards. No cross-token competition.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div className="payout-step">
              <h4>4. Manual Claiming</h4>
              <p>After resolution, winners must manually claim rewards from their Portfolio dashboard. No time limit for claiming.</p>
